# Operationalizing Machine Learning

## Overview
MLO's aspects have been explored in this project. Project contains three parts: Deploying the best model run by AutoML, consuming through the end points, and automating the process by creating a pipleine from creating the dataset to deploying model and scoring using that model by consuming the endpoint of deployed model.

Deploying the best model: AutoML run has been set up for given bank-marketing dataset for classification task type. Best model has been identified with highest accuracy. This model was deployed using the Azure ML UI using ACI container. 


## Architectural Diagram
*TODO*: Provide an architectual diagram of the project and give an introduction of each step. An architectural diagram is an image that helps visualize the flow of operations from start to finish. In this case, it has to be related to the completed project, with its various stages that are critical to the overall flow. For example, one stage for managing models could be "using Automated ML to determine the best model". 

## Key Steps
*TODO*: Write a short discription of the key steps. Remeber to include all the screenshots required to demonstrate key steps. 

## Screen Recording
*TODO* Provide a link to a screen recording of the project in action. Remember that the screencast should demonstrate:

## Standout Suggestions
*TODO (Optional):* This is where you can provide information about any standout suggestions that you have attempted.
